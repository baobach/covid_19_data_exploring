#This is the portfolio project showcasing my data analysis skills
In this project, you can find my SQL codes and Tableau dashboard sample.
The purpose of this project is to explore the Covid_19 Deaths rate among many countries in the world, including Vietnam.
The dataset is downloaded from "https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus". In this example, we only look at the deaths count and death rate.
The tools I'm using are Google Bigquery for querying data from the dataset and Tableau for data visualization.
1. In Covid_SQL_Dataset to Covid_SQL_Dataset.sql, you can find all the queries that explore the dataset. The purpose of this is to understand the dataset and create a working plan.
2. In tableau_sql_codes.sql, you can find all the queries that create tables for my Tableau Visualization.
3. In preview.jpg, you can look at the sample of my dashboard at "https://public.tableau.com/views/Covid_19PortfolioProject/Dashboard1?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link"
